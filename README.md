# Engineering Management Philosophy

## Introduction

Engineering Management must **not** be approached as an _ad hoc_, reactive responsibility with no formalized approach, but rather should be approached as a formal discipline. The below document is my personal Engineering Management philosophy and a document which I will continue to expand in the future.

Engineering Management is unique in that it sits at the convergence of three disciplines: Technology, Product Ownership, and Management. All three of the factors define  - to some extent - the scope of the Engineering Manager's work.

## Communication

### What Should Be Expected Of A Manager

#### 1. Performance

The _first_ question an Engineering Manager should seek to answer for his or her direct reports is how each direct report is performing. Let's re-read that: 

> The _first_ question an Engineering Manager should seek to answer **for** his or her direct reports is how each direct report is performing.

Note the emphasis on the "**for**" in the above sentence; the motivation for evaluating performance is the employee. Managers evaulate performance for no other reason than enabling employees to succeed. This will be critical in the later dicussion of [feedback](#feedback)

The primary purpose of an Engineering Manager is to ensure that each team member is regularly, directly, and actionably aware of their status within the organization; further, that status should not be of a surprise to any employee directly or indirectly reporting to a Manager. Every other aspect of Engineering Management serves this singular purpose: ensuring each Engineer within the responsible organization is succeeding or on a path to success.

This document will continue to explore the exact meaning of performance, later.

#### 2. Feedback

Suggestions not feedback. Concrete. Specific.

#### 2. Transparency

Actual performance cannot be communicated to direct reports unless an Engineering Manager commits to transparency.

#### 3. Timeliness

Timeliness (immediacy - proximity to event); ability to take action
