# Engineering Management Philosophy

## Introduction

Engineering Management must **not** be approached as an _ad hoc_, reactive responsibility with no formalized approach, but rather should be approached as a formal discipline. The below document is my personal Engineering Management philosophy and a document which I will continue to expand in the future.

Engineering Management is unique in that it sits at the convergence of three disciplines: Technology, Product Ownership, and Management. All three of the factors define  - to some extent - the scope of the Engineering Manager's work.

### What Should Be Expected Of A Manager

#### Guiding Principles

##### Transparency

Performance is not communicated to direct reports unless an Engineering Manager is committed to transparency.

##### Non-Retaliation

##### Respect

---- 

### Handling Performance

#### Performance

The _first_ question an Engineering Manager should seek to answer for his or her direct reports is how each direct report is performing. Let's re-read that: 

> The _first_ question an Engineering Manager should seek to answer **for** his or her direct reports is how each direct report is performing.

Note the emphasis on the "**for**" in the above sentence; the motivation for evaluating performance is the employee. Managers evaulate performance for no other reason than enabling employees to succeed. This will be critical in the later dicussion of [feedback](#feedback).

The primary purpose of the Engineering Manager is to ensure  each team member is regularly, directly, and actionably aware of their status (performance) within the organization; further, that status should not be of a surprise to any employee directly or indirectly reporting to a Manager. No employee should be unaweare of their performance. Every other aspect of Engineering Management serves this singular purpose: ensuring each Engineer within the responsible organization is succeeding or on a path to success.

This document will continue to explore the exact meaning of performance, later.

#### Communication

##### Feedback

Effective feedback is future-oriented, specific to a particular instance, concrete, immediate, and actionable. 

In order for feedback to be effective:

- Feedback must **focus on how to handle a past situation in the future** and viewed as **establishing expectations** that may not have previously been known.

- Feedback must be **isolated to a particular instance or instances** and must **only be offered in response to a historical event or events**. By rooting feedback in a particular occurence, managers ensure the feedback itself remains specific (not general) and concrete. 

- Feedback must be **specific**.

- Feedback that is observational and qualitative does not provide an employee with the framework for responding; however, feedback that provides concrete actions that can be taken in the same scenario should it arise again **establishes a concrete set of expectations to which to adhere**.

- Feedback must be actionable. Feedback must always be **in response to something that is alterable** (that can be changed); offering general qualitative, analytical feedback about character and virture is to be avoided.

###### Timeliness

Timeliness is a critera of effective feedback; feedback must be timely. However, "timeliness" is its own category here as it requires a little more attention. It is the Engineering Manager's responsibility to ensure that feedback is only offered when it is timely; there is a point - although subjective - at which feedback no longer becomes meaningful or appropriate to deliver. 

Feedback should be delivered in relative proximity to the occurrence the feedback addresses. The greater the amount of time between an event requiring feedback and the feedback, itself, the greater the disservice to the employee. Engineering Managers empower their employees by ensuring feedback is offered when an employee is able to recall the event. 

###### Take Notes

To ensure the ability to be specific to a particular event, an Engineering Manager should take notes in an appropriate format.

##### Ask First, Provide Feedback Second

An Engineering Manager that _starts_ by _telling_ an employee what happened - without first asking - is causing a disservice to the employee; "telling first" does not provide the opportunity for the employee to frame the situation without foreknowledge of the Manager's response. Rather than putting the employee in the position of providing their wholistic understanding of an event, you put the employee on the defensive. 

Further, an employee may already be aware of what they could have done differently.
