# Engineering Management Philosophy

## Introduction

Engineering Management must **not** be approached as an _ad hoc_, reactive responsibility with no formalized approach, but rather should be approached as a formal discipline. The below document is my personal Engineering Management philosophy and a document which I will continue to expand in the future.

Engineering Management is unique in that it sits at the convergence of three disciplines: Technology, Product Ownership, and Management. All three of the factors define  - to some extent - the scope of the Engineering Manager's work.
