# Engineering Management Philosophy

## Introduction

Engineering Management must **not** be approached as an _ad hoc_, reactive responsibility with no formalized approach, but rather should be approached as a formal discipline. The below document is my personal Engineering Management philosophy and a document which I will continue to expand in the future.

Engineering Management is unique in that it sits at the convergence of three disciplines: Technology, Product Ownership, and Management. All three of the factors define  - to some extent - the scope of the Engineering Manager's work.

### What Should Be Expected Of A Manager

#### Guiding Principles

##### Transparency

Performance is not communicated to direct reports unless an Engineering Manager is committed to transparency.

##### Non-Retaliation

##### Respect

---- 

### Handling Performance

#### Performance

The _first_ question an Engineering Manager should seek to answer for his or her direct reports is how each direct report is performing. Let's re-read that: 

> The _first_ question an Engineering Manager should seek to answer **for** his or her direct reports is how each direct report is performing.

Note the emphasis on the "**for**" in the above sentence; the motivation for evaluating performance is the employee. Managers evaulate performance for no other reason than enabling employees to succeed. This will be critical in the later dicussion of [feedback](#feedback).

The primary purpose of the Engineering Manager is to ensure  each team member is regularly, directly, and actionably aware of their status (performance) within the organization; further, that status should not be of a surprise to any employee directly or indirectly reporting to a Manager. No employee should be unaweare of their performance. Every other aspect of Engineering Management serves this singular purpose: ensuring each Engineer within the responsible organization is succeeding or on a path to success.

This document will continue to explore the exact meaning of performance, later.

#### Communication

##### Feedback

Effective feedback is future-oriented, specific to a particular instance, concrete, immediate, and actionable. 

In order for feedback to be effective:

- Feedback must **focus on how to handle a past situation in the future** and viewed as **establishing expectations** that may not have previously been known.

- Feedback must be **isolated to a particular instance or instances** and must **only be offered in response to a historical event or events**. By rooting feedback in a particular occurence, managers ensure the feedback itself remains specific (not general) and concrete. 

- Feedback must be **specific**.

- Feedback that is observational and qualitative does not provide an employee with the framework for responding; however, feedback that provides concrete actions that can be taken in the same scenario should it arise again **establishes a concrete set of expectations to which to adhere**.

- Feedback must be actionable. Feedback must always be **in response to something that is alterable** (that can be changed); offering general qualitative, analytical feedback about character and virture is to be avoided.

##### Timeliness

Timeliness (immediacy - proximity to event); ability to take action, Lack of recalability is a disservice

##### Ask First, Provide Feedback Second
